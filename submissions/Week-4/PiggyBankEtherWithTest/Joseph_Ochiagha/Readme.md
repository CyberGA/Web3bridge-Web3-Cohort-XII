PiggyBank Smart Contract

I decided to replicate the traditional PiggyBank concept in a smart contract. The PiggyBank smart contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds. The smart contract also allows users to check their balance.

The PiggyBank smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is deployed on the LiskSepolia test network.

The PiggyBank smart contract is deployed at the following address:



The PiggyBank smart contract has the following functions:

1. deposit: This function allows users to deposit funds into their PiggyBank.

2. withdraw: This function allows users to withdraw funds from their PiggyBank.

3. checkBalance: This function allows users to check their balance in the PiggyBank.

The PiggyBank smart contract is a simple example of how smart contracts can be used to replicate traditional financial services in a decentralized and trustless manner.

The PiggyBank smart contract is open source and can be accessed on GitHub at the following link:
